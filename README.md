# Movie Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering
With this Machine Learning Project, I will be building a movie recommendation system. The movie Recommendation system is used by all OTT platforms nowadays. As the name suggests itself that this system will recommend movies to users.

Collaborative Filtering
There are two ways to implement the recommendation system. One is using content-based filtering and the other is collaborative filtering.

Content-Based Filtering – In this, we train the recommendation system in a way that it suggests the movies based on the content that he likes in the past. Suppose, if a user watches an action movie and gave it a 5-star rating, then our system will suggest him more action movies.

Collaborative Filtering – In this, we train the recommendation system in a way that it suggests the movies based on what other users have liked. The system will try to find similarity between the user who watches the same kind of movies.
